### What is UFC Ripper?

An open-source video downloader tool for UFC Fight Pass, powered by [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
and [**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/), that can run on both the desktop and the cloud. The only thing it can't do is STEAL
videos free of charge for you. A **paid Fight Pass subscription** is required for this tool to work.

### Dear Dana White,

This isn't a tool created for pirating your copyrighted content. This tool requires a **PAID FIGHT PASS SUBSCRIPTION**
to function. This merely eliminates the need to stream a massive amount of data through metered connections every time
you want to go back and watch your favorite fighters. I want your fighters to be paid more. Not less. This tool is not
in any way meant to rob you or them of any revenue coming in.

The whole reason for me to create this tool is for my own needs. I live in a third-world country that was destroyed by
politicians. That made internet services more of a luxury than a right for the people of this country. Our internet
connections are very spotty and extremely limited. 1GB of data here costs more than a meal. Imagine that. I also travel,
and the only thing that can keep me entertained is some UFC. But how do I watch UFC if I can hardly find 4G
coverage in my messed-up land? 🤷🏽

The thing about Fight Pass is, you can't control how much of your quota it's going to burn. Also, repeated viewings
waste a ton of data. But my love for MMA and UFC is unconditional. So I decided to whip up this tool to eliminate all of
these mentioned issues. Then I thought, "Why not share this with the world? There might be a ton of other people like me
around the world". So here we are. Hope you'd understand, Dana. 🙂

# Support this project 🙏🏽

I get it, this isn't a perfect tool. There could be a few missing features and some bugs here and there. But this COULD
improve a lot. Working on this project and testing on all targets requires a lot of time and energy.

You can help me by buying me a few coffees ☕, so I'm all buzzed up and got time to work on this further.
Or you can send a few monies my way to simply say thanks for the work that's already been done.

**Wise is the preferred method for donations because PayPal takes a huge chunk (~22%) off of every
donation _(ko-fi also uses PayPal)_.**

# How to use?

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> UFC Ripper is available on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS), in both `x64` and `arm64` targets. It can also
> run on the cloud as a Docker container.

### Desktop

UFC Ripper is available on desktop, both as an Installer _(Windows)_ and a portable app.

1. Download the latest release corresponding to your system,
   - ### 🪟 [Windows (x64) [Installer]](https://github.com/m4heshd/ufc-ripper/releases/download/v4.0.1/ufc-ripper_4.0.1_x64-setup.exe)
   - ### 🪟 [Windows (x64) [Portable]](https://github.com/m4heshd/ufc-ripper/releases/download/v4.0.1/ufc-ripper-v4.0.1-win32-x64.zip)
   - ### 🐧 [Linux (x64) [Portable]](https://github.com/m4heshd/ufc-ripper/releases/download/v4.0.1/ufc-ripper-v4.0.1-linux-x64.zip)
   - ### 🐧 [Linux (arm64) [Portable]](https://github.com/m4heshd/ufc-ripper/releases/download/v4.0.1/ufc-ripper-v4.0.1-linux-arm64.zip)
   - ### 🍎 [macOS (x64) [Portable]](https://github.com/m4heshd/ufc-ripper/releases/download/v4.0.1/ufc-ripper-v4.0.1-macos-x64.zip)
   - ### 🍎 [macOS (arm64) [Portable]](https://github.com/m4heshd/ufc-ripper/releases/download/v4.0.1/ufc-ripper-v4.0.1-macos-arm64.zip)

2. Run the installer or extract the content of the zip file to anywhere you like

3. Run the executable file (`ufc-ripper.exe` or `ufc-ripper`) _(Installer version should have a shortcut on the start
   menu)_

4. Open the browser and visit the URL shown in the console window. _(it should automatically open on the default
   browser)_

5. The first run might ask you to download some third-party tools used by UFC Ripper. Click yes, and it will
   automatically download the latest versions from [media-tools](https://github.com/m4heshd/media-tools) repo.

> [!NOTE]
> **For macOS users:**
>
> The first launch of the application may give you an error saying `"ufc-ripper" is damaged and can't be opened`. This
> is because the build is not signed. Nothing to worry there.
>
> Simply right-click on the UFC Ripper folder, open up a new Terminal at the folder, and run `xattr -c ufc-ripper`.
>
> Now you should be able to double-click on the `ufc-ripper` executable, and it should run perfectly fine.

### Docker

> [!NOTE]
> The Docker image is available in `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` targets, which means it can natively run
> on ARM-based systems like the Raspberry Pi, Snapdragon, and Apple Silicon devices.

You can either build the Docker image locally and run using [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml) or use the
published [official image](https://hub.docker.com/r/m4heshd/ufc-ripper).

To build and run locally, simply run `npm run docker:up`. This is a standalone Dockerfile where both the app-building
process and the runtime is done inside a multi-stage build, so the host will not require any build tools or libraries
installed.

Here's a docker-compose template for you lazies out there.

```yaml
services:
  ufc-ripper:
    image: m4heshd/ufc-ripper:latest # Using the latest version of the official image
    container_name: ufc-ripper
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config:/ufcr/config # Any configuration files will be stored here
      - ~/Downloads/ufc-ripper:/downloads # Downloaded videos will be stored here
    ports:
      - "8383:8383" # Web UI port
```

That's it.

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to have a UFC Fight Pass account with a **paid subscription**, and to be logged into that account to use UFC
> Ripper.

1. Open up the GUI in the browser and go into Configuration (⚙️ button) and log in with your UFC Fight Pass account
   using the "Fight Pass account" section.

2. Once successfully logged in, you can search for videos and download them, or copy and paste a link to a UFC Fight
   Pass video in the "Link" input and hit the download button.

3. Optionally, look through the configuration to change any download settings (video quality, audio quality, etc..) to
   your needs

## How to update?

The application will automatically notify you of any available updates on launch. You can visit the download URL and
download your preferred build.

On portable builds, you pretty much only have to replace the primary executable file (`ufc-ripper.exe` or `ufc-ripper`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not replace the `config.json` file if you would like to preserve your existing configuration, including the
> logged-in session. UFC Ripper will migrate your existing configuration automatically into any new version on the next
> launch of the app.

If you're using the installed version on Windows, simply run the new installer, and it will update your existing build.
The update installation will preserve your existing configuration by default. Just like the portable version, it will
migrate your existing configuration automatically on the next launch.

## Mention-worthy features

### Advanced search

If you have ever used UFC Fight Pass search, you know how difficult it is to find the video you're actually looking for
on there. But not to worry, because UFC Ripper supports much more advanced and precise searching of the Fight Pass
library than UFC Fight Pass itself.

You can restrict the search algorithm to only look inside the event titles, which would result in way more accurate
results, or you can use advanced query syntax like double quotes and negative symbol, like you would on Google search.

### Streaming

UFC Ripper can stream videos directly, right from the search results. The advantage of streaming in UFC Ripper is that
you're the one in control. You can force the player to stream the video in your preferred settings, unlike the UFC Fight
Pass. You choose how much of your data quota you'll be burning to watch a video.

### Concurrent multi-fragment downloads

UFC Fight Pass streams are very heavily limited to slower bandwidths. But these streams are broken down into little
fragments. This feature allows you to download a given number of fragments concurrently, which multiplies the speed of
downloads by the number of allowed concurrent fragment downloads. You can set the amount in the configuration as you
wish.

### Proxy support

This might come in handy when you run UFC Ripper as a Docker container in the cloud because the service blocks any
requests initiated using a datacenter IP address.

If you set up a proxy, UFC Ripper will forward all API requests through that proxy server. Remember, only the API
requests will go through the proxy. Not the downloads. This also means that your proxy server will hardly have to
transfer any data through it.

### File numbering

UFC Ripper can automatically number each download incrementally. Let's say you discovered a fighter you haven't watched
before and are interested in watching all of their fights in order. This feature would be beneficial in an event like
that.

## Development

You need to have the Rust compiler, platform build tools, and Node.js (>=22) installed locally to develop, compile,
and package this project yourself.

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/m4heshd/ufc-ripper.git`

2. `cd` into the `ufc-ripper` directory and run `npm install`

That's it. Now you're ready to go.

**To run for development,**

In development mode, the backend is configured to run on port `8383` and the frontend is set to run on port `8384`.
You can change this behavior by editing the port in `config.json`, `frontend/.env` and `vite.config.mjs`

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend and the backend with Vue HMR support

2. Open the browser and visit `http://localhost:8384/` _(if you visit `http://localhost:8383/`, you'll be viewing the
   production version of the frontend without the HMR support instead)_

**To package the application for production,**

1. Run `npm run build:backend:win32` or `npm run build:backend:linux` to build both the frontend and the backend

2. Run `npm run pack:win32` or `npm run pack:linux` (packaging process is NOT cross-platform compatible)

**To build and run the Docker container,**

1. Run `npm run docker:up`

The Dockerfile used for this build ([`build.Dockerfile`](build.Dockerfile)) is a multi-stage build file that builds
both the application and the runtime image. If you're planning on testing only inside the Docker image, your host will
not need any compilers or platform build tools.

All Rust compilation steps will also be cached in the initial build, which makes any subsequent builds significantly
faster.
